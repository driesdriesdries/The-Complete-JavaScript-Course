//Const is used to declare a variable that will never change

//You are not allowed to declare empty vairables with const

//by default, rather used const, unless super sure the 

//var should be avoided as it's legacy stuff. Works the same as let. variables can also be mutated
//make sure to properly declare variables.


//Math Operators Lesson

//Assignment operators
let x = 10 + 5; //15
x += 10; // x = x+10 which makes it 25

//Comparison Operators
//Used to produce boolean values
